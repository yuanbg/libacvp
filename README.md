## License
Libacvp is licensed under the Apache License 2.0, which means that
you are free to get and use it for commercial and non-commercial
purposes as long as you fulfill its conditions. See the LICENSE
file for details.


## Recent Changes
The client library is compatible with the ACVP spec version 1.0, see https://github.com/usnistgov/ACVP
however not all algorithms and options are supported. See the support list in the Supported Algorithms
section below.

Support for new algorithms and features is being added fairly regularly. Recent features also include the
ability to cancel test sessions and more configure options to help various different build configurations
and platforms.


# Overview

Libacvp is a client-side ACVP library implementation, and also includes
an example application (acvp_app) which utilizes the library.

libacvp will login and then register with the ACVP server (advertising capabilities).
The server will respond with a list of vector set identifiers that need to be processed.
libacvp will download each vector set, process the vectors, and send the results back to the server.
This is performed in real-time by default. The user can also use "offline" mode for non-realtime
processing.

The `app/` directory contains a sample application which uses libacvp. This app
provides the glue between the crypto module DUT and the library itself.
Depending upon the DUT, the crypto backend API, and other factors, the user
may need to enhance the reference application, or create a new one from scratch.

The application within `app/` is only provided here for unit testing and demonstrating how to use libacvp. 
The application layer (app_main.c) is required to interface with the crypto module that will
be tested. In this example it uses OpenSSL, which introduces libcrypto.so as
the DUT.

The library also provides an example on how a standalone module could be
tested. In this case it uses the OpenSSL FOM canister. The FOM canister
has a few algorithms that can only be tested when not running in a final
product. These algorithms can be tested under this configuration.
The FOM build also requires the path to the canister header files and object which
is defined in the `./configure` CLI to enable non-runtime shown below which
automatically adds the compile time flag -DACVP_NO_RUNTIME.

The `certs/` directory contains the certificates used to establish a TLS
session with well-known ACVP servers. If the ACVP server uses a self-signed certificate,
then the proper CA file must be specified.
libacvp also requires a client certificate and key pair,
which the ACVP server uses to identify the client. You will need to
contact NIST to register your client certificate with their server.

The murl directory contains experimental code to replace the Curl
dependency. This may be useful for target platforms that don't support
Curl, such as Android or iOS. Murl is a "minimal" Curl implementation.
It implements a handful of the Curl API entry points used by libacvp.
The Murl code is currently in an experimental stage and is not supported
or maintained as part of libacvp and should not be used in any
production environment.


## Dependencies
* autotools
* gcc
* make
* curl (or substitution)
* openssl (or substitution)

Curl is used for sending REST calls to the ACVP server.

Openssl is used for TLS transport by libcurl.

Parson is used to parse and generate JSON data for the REST calls.
The parson code is included and compiled as part of libacvp.

libcurl, libssl and libcrypto are not included, and must
be installed separately on your build/target host,
including the header files.

##### Dealing with system-default dependencies
This codebase uses features in OpenSSL >= 1.0.2.
If the system-default install does not meet this requirement,
you will need to download, compile and install at least OpenSSL 1.0.2 on your system.
The new OpenSSL resources should typically be installed into /usr/local/ssl to avoid
overwriting the default OpenSSL that comes with your distro.

It is highly recommended to use versions of OpenSSL 1.1.1 or greater when possible, 
as all previous versions have reached end of life status. 

A potential source of issues is the default libcurl on the Linux distro, which may be linked against
the previously mentioned default OpenSSL. This could result in linker failures when trying to use
the system default libcurl with the new OpenSSL install (due to missing symbols).
Therefore, you SHOULD download the Curl source, compile it against the "new" OpenSSL
header files, and link libcurl against the "new" OpenSSL. 
libacvp uses compile time macro logic to address differences in the APIs of different OpenSSL
versions; therefore, it is important that you ensure libacvp is linking to the correct openSSL versions
at run time as well.

Libacvp is designed to work with curl version 7.61.0 or newer. Some operating systems may ship with
older versions of Curl which are missing certain features that libacvp depends on. In this case you
should either acquire a newer version through your OS package manager if possible or build a newer
version from source. While it is possible some older versions may work, they are not tested or
supported.

## Building

`--prefix<path to install dir>` can be used with any configure options to specify where you would
like the library and application to install to. 

#### To build for runtime testing

```
./configure --with-ssl-dir=<path to ssl dir> --with-libcurl-dir=<path to curl dir>
make clean
make
make install
```

#### To build for non-runtime testing

```
./configure --with-ssl-dir=<path to ssl dir> --with-fom_dir=<path to where FOM is installed> --with-libcurl-dir=<path to curl dir>
make clean
make
make install
```

#### Building libacvp without the application code.
Use the following ./configure comand line option and only the library will be built and installed.

--disable-app

Note that this option is not useful when building for offline testing since the application is needed.
Using this option, only a libcurl installation dir needs to be provided.
 
#### Building acvp_app only without the library code
Use the following ./configure comand line option and only the app will be built. Note that it depends
on libacvp having already been built. The libacvp directory can be provided using --with-libacvp-dir=
Otherwise, it will look in the default build directory in the root folder for libacvp.

--disable-lib

#### Other build options
More info about all available configure options can be found by using ./configure --help. Some important
ones include:
--enable-offline : Will link to all dependencies statically and remove the libcurl dependency. See "How
 to test offline" for more details.
--disable-kdf : Will disable kdf registration and processing in the application, in cases where the given
 crypto implementation does not support it (E.g. OpenSSL FOM 2.X.X)
--disable-lib-check : This will disable autoconf's attempts to automatically detect prerequisite libraries
 before building libacvp. This may be useful in some edge cases where the libraries exist but autoconf
 cannot detect them; however, it will give more cryptic error messages in the make stage if there are issues


#### Cross Compiling
Requires options --build and --host.
Your `$PATH` must contain a path the gcc.

```
export CROSS_COMPILE=powerpc-buildroot-linux-uclibc
./configure --build=<local target prefix> --host=<gcc prefix of target host> --with-ssl-dir=<path to ssl dir> --with-libcurl-dir=<path to curl dir>
```

Example with build and host information:
```
./configure --build=localx86_64-unknown-linux-gnu --host=mips64-octeon-linux-gnu --with-ssl-dir=<path to ssl dir> --with-libcurl-dir=<path to curl dir>`
```
All dependent libraries must have been built with the same cross compile.

If using murl for cross compliles use the same CROSS_COMPILE and HOSTCC used with openssl, for example:

CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf-
HOSTCC=gcc

## Windows
The Visual Studio projects for acvp_app and libacvp are set to use 2017 tools and are designed to
be easily updated to use the latest versions of Microsoft build tools while being backwards
compatible with Visual Studio 2017 and some older Windows 10 SDK versions.

Prerequisites:
This system assumes all dependency library paths have /include folders containing all the headers
needed to properly link. This can be altered in the scripts if needed.

For acvp_app, If you are using a FIPS Object Module with OpenSSL: you need a header in your 
/include folder that maps FIPS functions to SSL ones (for example, fipssyms.h) which is sometimes
not moved to the install path from the source path by default on Windows.

For these steps, use the Visual Studio Command Prompt for your platform (x64, x86, x86_64, or 
x64_86)

Steps:
1.) Edit and run ms\config_windows.bat
    -Add all of the directories for your dependencies
	-Change any needed settings
2.) Open libacvp.sln and acvp_app.sln in Visual Studio and allow the dialog to update the projects'
    versions of MSVC and windows SDK to the latest installed (May be unnecessary if versions match)
3.) run ms/make_lib.bat
4.) run ms/make_app.bat

The library files and app files will be placed in the ms/build/ directory.

Notes:
Windows will only search specific paths for shared libraries, and will not check the
locations you specify in config_windows.bat by default unless they are in your path. This results
in acvp_app not being able to run. An alternative to altering your path or moving libraries to
system folders is moving/copying any needed .dll files to the same directory as acvp_app.

If you are building statically, it is assumed for acvp_app that you have built Curl with OpenSSL, 
and that you are linking acvp_app to the exact same version of OpenSSL that Curl is linked to. Other
configurations are not supported, untested, and may not work. Libacvp itself is indifferent
to which crypto and SSL libraries Curl uses, but any applications using libacvp statically
need to link to those libraries.

Murl is not supported in windows at this time.

## Running
1. `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="<path to ssl lib;path to curl lib>"`
2. Modify scripts/nist_setup.sh and run `source scripts/nist_setup.sh`
3. `./app/acvp_app --<options>`

Use `./app/acvp_app --help` for more information on available options.

libacvp generates a file containing information that can be used to resume or check the results
of a session. By default, this is usually placed in the folder of the executable utilizing
libacvp, though this can be different on some OS. The name, by default, is
testSession_(ID number).json. The path and prefix can be controlled using ACV_SESSION_SAVE_PATH
and ACV_SESSION_SAVE_PREFIX in your environment, respectively. 

### How to test offline
1. Download vectors on network accessible device:
`./app/acvp_app --<algs of choice or all_algs> --vector_req <filename1>`
 - where `<filename1>` is the file you are saving the tests to.

2. Copy vectors and acvp_app to target:
`./app/acvp_app --all_algs --vector_req <filename1> --vector_rsp <filename2>`
 - where `<filename1>` is the file the tests are saved in, and `<filename2>` is the file
you want to save your results to.

3. Copy responses(filename2) to network accessible device:
`./app/acvp_app --all_algs --vector_upload <filename2>`
 - where `<filename2>` is the file containing the results of the tests.

*Note:* If the target in Step 2 does not have the standard libraries used by
libacvp you may configure and build a special app used only for Step 2. This
can be done by using --enable-offline and --enable-static when running 
./configure and do not use --with-libcurl-dir or --with-libmurl-dir which
will  minimize the library dependencies. Note that openssl with FOM must also
be built as static. For this case, OpenSSL MUST be built with the "no-dso" option,
OR the configure option `--enable-offline-ldl-check` must be used to resolve the libdl
dependency. Some specific versions of SSL may not be able to remove the libdl dependency.

For example:
```
export FIPSLD_CC=gcc     (or whatever compiler is being used)
./configure --with-ssl-dir=<ciscossl install> --with-fom-dir=<fom install> --prefix=<libacvp install> --enable-static --enable-offline
```

## Testing
Move to the test/ directory and see the README.md there. The tests depend upon
a C test framework called Criterion, found here: https://github.com/Snaipe/Criterion


## Contributing
Before opening a pull request on libacvp, please ensure that all unit tests are
passing. Additionally, new tests should be added for new library features.

We also run the uncrustify tool as a linter to keep code-style consistent
throughout the library. That can be found in the `uncrustify/` directory.

Any and all new API functions must also be added to ms\resources\source.def.

## FAQ

`I get "unable to process test vectors" for certain algorithms when libacvp is built without a FOM. Why?`
Some algorithms need to have internal mechanisms tested that are not available in the
regular APIs for that algorithm. These cannot be tested at runtime and are only avaible to
be tested when linked to a FOM for non-runtime testing. --all_algs attempts to run these
algorithms as well, so for runtime testing without linking to a FOM, specify the algorithms
you wish to run individually.

`I get some sort of hard crash while processing vector sets - why?`
It is probable that libacvp is linking to a different version of a library than the one
it was configured and built with. libacvp/acvp_app depend on library versions in enabling 
or disabling certain features at build time, so please make sure libacvp and acvp_app are 
built and run with the same versions of each library.

`Can I redownload vector sets from a previously created session?`
Yes. running acvp_app with the --resume_session AND --vector_req options will redownload
those vector sets to the given file without processing or uploading anything. See the app
help section for more details about these commands.

`I have been getting retry messages for X amount of time. Is this normal?`
Yes; the server actively sends retry messages when it is still in the process of generating
tests or waiting to generate tests. This period of time can vary wildly if the server is under
intense load, anywhere from a few seconds to a few days. If there is an issue and the connection
is lost or the server experiences an error, the library output will indicate it.

`I recieved a vector set from somewhere other than libacvp, such as a lab. How can I process it?`
Libacvp expects vector set json files to have a specific formatting. It is possible to manually
modify the JSON file to make it work though we do not officially support or endorse this process.
Moving your vector set into a json array, and putting this as the json object before the vector set
should allow libacvp to process it using the offline testing process described above; you would
also need to remove these entries from the output file.
```
{
    "jwt": "NA",
    "url": "NA",
    "isSample": false,
    "vectorSetUrls": [
        "NA"
    ]
}
```
Note that this file will not be able to be submitted using libacvp unless you manually input all
of the correct information in the above object; we do not recommend this and you should instead
try to submit via wherever you originally got the vector set from.
